5. Write a console program for the following question.  Given an input file

of strings, you are tasked with determining the minimum and maximum

length of N number of strings joined together. Be sure to write your

program such that it takes up as little memory as possible when

running. The file format will be as follows: 

1. The first line of the file will contain a number N, which will be the number of

strings you’ll need to join together to determine the min and max lengths. N will

be >= 2. 

2. Each line after the first will contain one or more ‘#’ characters. The number

of lines will be >=N and you will need to use the length of these lines to

determine the min and max lengths. Your output will simple be the minimum

and maximum length."
